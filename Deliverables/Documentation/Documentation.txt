Section 2

Description of World:
My world is a desert scene, complete with a logoon and a camel to drink out of it. Its full of sand, desert fauna 
and flora, and even a bit of quicksand.

World Exploration:
The world includes a set of 8 cameras for the user to use to view the scene. 
The first camera looks down on the entire scene.
The second camera follows the average position of the flock of scorpions.
The third camera follows the position of the desert shrew.
The fourth camera follows the position of the camel.
The fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth cameras show the world from its 4 corners.

Flocking:
The scorpions in the scene are my flockers. They seek the desert shrew and are trying to eat it.

Path Following:
The camel is my path follower. It follows the path through the desert until he reaches the lagoon, 
circle's the lagoon to enjoy the cooler air of the area, and then continues on his journey.

Flow Field Following:
The desert shrew is my flow field follower. He searches the desert for shade and bugs, and also flees the 
scorpions that are trying to eat him.

Area of Resistance:
My area of resistance is the sink hole in the middle of the scene, denoted by the different color sand, and the 
debug lines that make a square in the center of the scene. The shrew and the scorpions are slowed down when they 
enter this area.

Resources:
I used The Nature of Code by Daniel Shiffman to guide me in coding all of my algorithms.

I used free models from the unity store for my environment and I used free models from Google Poly for my 
creatures.

Bugs:
The shrew dosn't seem to be avoiding the pond or surrounding rocks for some reason that I can't figure out.
The shrew and the scorpions do not avoid the mountains.
